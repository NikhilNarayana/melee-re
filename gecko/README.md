# Gecko Codes
Source for various patches/Gecko codes. Note that, in order to compile 
particular patches into sets of Gecko codes, you will probably need to 
install devkitPPC (or obtain some copy of an assembler targeting GC/Wii) 
and [JLaferri/gecko](https://github.com/JLaferri/gecko).

[macro.asm](macro.asm) contains useful macros and other globals relevant 
for targeting different versions of the game.
